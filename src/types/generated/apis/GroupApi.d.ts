The number of groups returned depends on the specified [`limit`](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroups!in=query&path=limit&t=request), if you have a search, filter, and/or query parameter set, and if that parameter is not null. We recommend using a limit less than or equal to 200.  A subset of groups can be returned that match a supported filter expression, query, or search criteria.  > **Note:** Results from the filter or query parameter are driven from an eventually consistent datasource. The synchronization lag is typically less than one second.
     * List all groups
     * @param search Searches for groups with a supported [filtering](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#filter) expression for all properties except for &#x60;_embedded&#x60;, &#x60;_links&#x60;, and &#x60;objectClass&#x60;. This operation supports [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination).  Using search requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding), for example, &#x60;search&#x3D;type eq \&quot;OKTA_GROUP\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;search&#x3D;type+eq+%22OKTA_GROUP%22&#x60;.  This operation searches many properties:  * Any group profile attribute, including imported app group profile attributes. * The top-level properties: &#x60;id&#x60;, &#x60;created&#x60;, &#x60;lastMembershipUpdated&#x60;, &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60;, and &#x60;type&#x60;. * The [source](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroups!c&#x3D;200&amp;path&#x3D;_links/source&amp;t&#x3D;response) of groups with type of &#x60;APP_GROUP&#x60;, accessed as &#x60;source.id&#x60;.  You can also use the &#x60;sortBy&#x60; and &#x60;sortOrder&#x60; parameters.  Searches for groups can be filtered by the following operators: &#x60;sw&#x60;, &#x60;eq&#x60;, and &#x60;co&#x60;. You can only use &#x60;co&#x60; with these select profile attributes: &#x60;profile.name&#x60; and &#x60;profile.description&#x60;. See [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators).
     * @param filter Filter expression for groups. See [Filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#filter).  &gt; **Note:** All filters must be [URL encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). For example, &#x60;filter&#x3D;lastUpdated gt \&quot;2013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;filter&#x3D;lastUpdated%20gt%20%222013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z%22&#x60;.
     * @param q Finds a group that matches the &#x60;name&#x60; property. &gt; **Note:** Paging and searching are currently mutually exclusive. You can\&#39;t page a query. The default limit for a query is 300 results. Query is intended for an auto-complete picker use case where users refine their search string to constrain the results.
     * @param after Specifies the pagination cursor for the next page of groups. The &#x60;after&#x60; cursor should be treated as an opaque value and obtained through the next link relation. See [Pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination).
     * @param limit Specifies the number of group results in a page.  Okta recommends using a specific value other than the default or maximum. If your request times out, retry your request with a smaller &#x60;limit&#x60; and [page the results](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination).  The Okta default &#x60;Everyone&#x60; group isn\&#39;t returned for users with a group admin role.
     * @param expand If specified, additional metadata is included in the response. Possible values are &#x60;stats&#x60; and &#x60;app&#x60;. This additional metadata is listed in the [&#x60;_embedded&#x60;](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/addGroup!c&#x3D;200&amp;path&#x3D;_embedded&amp;t&#x3D;response) property of the response.  &gt; **Note:** You can use the &#x60;stats&#x60; value to return the number of users within a group. This is listed as the &#x60;_embedded.stats.usersCount&#x60; value in the response. See this [Knowledge Base article](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/Is-there-an-API-that-returns-the-number-of-users-in-a-group?language&#x3D;en_US) for more information and an example.
     * @param sortBy Specifies field to sort by **(for search queries only)**. &#x60;sortBy&#x60; can be any single property, for example &#x60;sortBy&#x3D;profile.name&#x60;.
     * @param sortOrder Specifies sort order: &#x60;asc&#x60; or &#x60;desc&#x60; (for search queries only). This parameter is ignored if &#x60;sortBy&#x60; isn\&#39;t present. Groups with the same value for the &#x60;sortBy&#x60; property are ordered by &#x60;id&#x60;\&#39;.
