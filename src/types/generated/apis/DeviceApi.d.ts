You can return a subset of devices that match a supported search criteria using the `search` query parameter. Searches for devices based on the properties specified in the `search` parameter conforming SCIM filter specifications (case-insensitive). This data is eventually consistent. The API returns different results depending on specified queries in the request. Empty list is returned if no objects match `search` request. > **Note:** Listing devices with `search` should not be used as a part of any critical flow, such as authentication or updates, to prevent potential data loss. `search` results may not reflect the latest information, as this endpoint uses a search index which may not be up-to-date with recent updates to the object.  Don\'t use search results directly for record updates, as the data might be stale and therefore overwrite newer data, resulting in data loss.   Use an `id` lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data.  This operation requires [URL encoding](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1). For example, `search=profile.displayName eq \"Bob\"` is encoded as `search=profile.displayName%20eq%20%22Bob%22`.
