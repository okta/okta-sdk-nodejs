/**
* A `transaction` object comprises contextual information associated with its respective event. This information is useful for understanding sequences of correlated events. For example, a `transaction` object such as the following: ``` {   \"id\": \"Wn4f-0RQ8D8lTSLkAmkKdQAADqo\",   \"type\": \"WEB\",   \"detail\": null } ``` indicates that a `WEB` request with `id` `Wn4f-0RQ8D8lTSLkAmkKdQAADqo` has created this event.  A `transaction` object with a `requestApiTokenId` in the `detail` object, for example : ``` {   \"id\": \"YjSlblAAqnKY7CdyCkXNBgAAAIU\",   \"type\": \"WEB\",   \"detail\": {     \"requestApiTokenId\": \"00T94e3cn9kSEO3c51s5\"   } } ``` indicates that this event was the result of an action performed through an API using the token identified by 00T94e3cn9kSEO3c51s5. The token ID is visible in the Admin Console, **Security** > **API**. See [API token management](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=Security_API). For more information on API tokens, see [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/).
