* User verification settings for verification. This setting controls the user verification requirement during authentication (verification). It determines whether the authenticator requires user verification when a user signs in with an already-registered credential.  For verification, the value defaults to `PREFERRED`, unless the enrollment setting is `REQUIRED`. If the enrollment setting is `REQUIRED` for the authenticator, then the verification setting is also implicitly `REQUIRED`.  > **Note:** This setting is only available when you have enabled the **Passkeys Rebrand** feature. See [Enable self-service features](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Manage_Early_Access_features).
