/**
* An object to return an error. Returning an error causes Okta to record a failure event in the Okta System Log. The string supplied in the `errorSummary` property is recorded in the System Log event. > **Note:** If the error object doesn\'t include the defined `errorSummary` property, the following common default message is returned to the end user: `The callback service returned an error`.  > **Note:** If a response to a SAML inline hook request isn\'t received from your external service within three seconds, a timeout occurs. In this scenario, the Okta SAML inline hook process continues, and the user is created.
