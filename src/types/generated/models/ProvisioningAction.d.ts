* Specifies the user provisioning action during authentication when an IdP user isn\'t linked to an existing Okta user. * To successfully provision a new Okta user, you must enable just-in-time (JIT) provisioning in your org security settings. * If the target username isn\'t unique or the resulting Okta user profile is missing a required profile attribute, JIT provisioning may fail. * New Okta users are provisioned with either a `FEDERATION` or `SOCIAL` authentication provider depending on the IdP type.
