  /**
    * Specifies the Windows version requirements for the assurance policy. Each requirement must correspond to a different major version (Windows 11 or Windows 10). If a requirement isn\'t specified for a major version, then devices on that major version satisfy the condition.  There are two types of OS requirements: * **Static**: A specific Windows version requirement that doesn\'t change until you update the policy. A static OS Windows requirement is specified with `majorVersionConstraint` and `minimum`. * **Dynamic**: A Windows version requirement that is relative to the latest major release and security patch. A dynamic OS Windows requirement is specified with `majorVersionConstraint` and `dynamicVersionRequirement`.  > **Note:** Dynamic OS requirements are available only if the **Dynamic OS version compliance** [self-service EA](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature is enabled. The `osVersionConstraints` property is only supported for the Windows platform. You can\'t specify both `osVersion.minimum` and `osVersionConstraints` properties at the same time.
