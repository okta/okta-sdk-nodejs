/**
* Settings for custom telephony provider.  These settings vary based on the telephony provider and the type of telephony operation (SMS or Voice). For `sms` and `call`, you can select one method per telephony operation (`sms` and `call`) for sending messages or voice calls.  > **Note:** Configure your telephony provider settings before selecting the methods for sending SMS messages or making voice calls. For example, if you select Twilio as your telephony provider, and you want to send SMS messages using Twilio\'s Verify Service, ensure that you have the Verify Service set up in your Twilio account. You can then use the `twilioVerifySid` field under `sms` to provide the necessary SID.
