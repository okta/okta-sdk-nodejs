# okta-sdk-nodejs

Node.js API Client for the [Okta Platform API].

Requires Node.js version 4.8.3 or higher.

## :warning: :construction: Alpha Preview :construction: :warning:

This library is under development and is currently a 0.x version series.  Breaking changes will be introduced as minor version bumps in the 0.x range.  Some of the API is not yet expressed in this library, please use your IDE hints or view [src/api-client.js](src/api-client.js) to browse available methods.  We will eventually publish the JsDoc documentation on https://developer.okta.com.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs
```

## Usage

All usage of this SDK begins with the creation of a client, the client handles the authentication and communication with the Okta API.  To create a client, you need to provide it the URL of your Okta Org, and an API Token that you have provisioned for yourself (this can be done by visiting Admin -> Security -> API -> Tokens in your Okta Developer Dashboard):

```javascript
const okta = require('@okta/okta-sdk-nodejs');

const client = new okta.Client({
  orgUrl: 'https://dev-1234.oktapreview.com/'
  token: 'xYzabc'    // Obtained from Developer Dashboard
});
```

It is also possible to provide configuration through environment variables or YAML files.  Please see [Configuration](#configuration) for examples.

## Examples

This libray is a wrapper for the [Okta Platform API], which should be referred to as the source-of-truth for what is and isn't possible with the API.  In the following sections we show you how to use your client to perform some common operations with the [Okta Platform API].

* [Create a User](#create-a-user)
* [Get a User](#get-a-user)
* [Update a User](#update-a-user)
* [Delete a User](#delete-a-user)
* [List All Org Users](#list-all-org-users)
* [Search for Users](#search-for-users)
* [Create a Group](#create-a-group)
* [Assign a User to a Group](#assign-a-user-to-a-group)
* [Collections](#collections)
  * [each](#each)

#### Create a User

The [Users: Create User] API can be used to create users.  The most basic type of user is one that has an email address and a password to login with, and can be created with the `client.createUser()` method:

```javascript
const newUser = {
  profile: {
    firstName: 'Foo',
    lastName: 'Bar',
    email: 'foo@example.com',
    login: 'foo@example.com',
  },
  credentials: {
    password : {
      value: 'PasswordAbc123'
    }
  }
};

client.createUser(newUser)
.then(user => {
  console.log('Created user', user);
});
```

#### Get a User

The [Users: Get User] API can be used to fetch a user by id or login (as defined on their `profile.login` property), and is wrapped by `client.getUser(:id|:login)`:

```javascript
client.getUser('ausmvdt5xg8wRVI1d0g3').then(user => {
  console.log(user);
});

client.getUser('foo@bar.com').then(user => {
  console.log(user);
});
```

#### Update a User

Once you have a user instance, you can modify it and then call the `update()` method to persist those changes to the API.  This uses the [Users: Update User] API:

```javascript
user.profile.nickName = 'rob';
user.update().then(() => console.log('User nickname change has been saved'));
```

#### Delete a User

Before deleting an Okta user, they must first be deactivated.  Both operations are done with the [Users: Lifecycle Operations] API.  We can chain the `deactivate()` and `delete` operations on the user instance to achieve both calls:

```javascript
user.deactivate()
.then(() => console.log('User has been deactivated'))
.then(() => user.delete())
.then(() => console.log('User has been deleted'));
```

#### List All Org Users

The client can be used to fetch collections of resources, in this example we'll use the [Users: List Users] API.  When fetching collections, you can use the `each()` method to iterate through the collection.  For more information see [Collections](#collections).

```javascript
const orgUsersCollection = client.listUsers();

orgUsersCollection.each(user => {
  console.log(user);
})
.then(() => console.log('All users have been listed'));
```

For more information about this API see [Users: Get User].

#### Search for Users

The [Users: List Users] API provides three ways to search for users, "q", "filter", or "search", and all of these approaches can be achieved by passing them as query parameters to the `client.listUser()` method.  The library will URL encode the values for you.

```javascript
client.listUsers({
  q: 'Robert'
}).each(user => {
  console.log('User matches query: ', user);
});

client.listUsers({
  search: 'profile.nickName eq "abc 1234"'
}).each(user => {
  console.log('User matches search:', user);
});

client.listUsers({
  filter: 'lastUpdated gt "2017-06-05T23:00:00.000Z"'
}).each(user => {
  console.log('User matches filter:', user);
});
```

#### Create a Group

The [Groups: Add Group] API allows you to create Groups, and this is wrapped by `client.createGroup(:newGroup)`:

```javascript
const newGroup = {
  profile: {
    name: 'Admin Users Group'
  }
};

client.createGroup(newGroup)
.then(group => {
  console.log('Created group', group);
});
```

#### Assign a User to a Group

With a user and group instance, you can use the `addToGroup(:groupId)` method of the user to add the user to the known group:

```javascript
user.addToGroup(group.id).then(() => console.log('User has been added to group'));
```

## Collections

When the client is used to fetch collections of resources, a collection instance is returned.  The collection encapsulates the work of paginating the API to fetch all resources in the collection (see [Pagination]).  The collection provides the `each()` method for iterating over the collection, as described below.

### `each()`

Allows you to visit every item in the collection, while optionally doing work at each item.  All calls to `each()` will return a promise that is resolved when all items have been visited or rejected if you return a rejected promise from your iterator.  Iteration can be stopped by rejecting a returned promise, or by returning `false` (will not cause a promise rejection).  The following examples show you the various use-cases.

#### Serial or Parallel Synchronous Work

If no value is returned, each() will continue to the next item:

```javascript
client.listUsers().each(user => {
  console.log(user);
  logUserToRemoteSystem(user);
}).then(() => {
  console.log('All users have been vistied');
});
```

#### Serial Asynchronous Work

Returning a promise will pause the iterator until the promise is resolved:

```javascript
client.listUsers().each(user => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // do work, then resolve or reject the promise
  })
});
```

#### Ending Iteration

Returning false will end iteration:

```javascript
client.listUsers().each(user => {
  console.log(user);
  return false;
}).then(() => {
  console.log('Only one user was visited');
});
```

Returning false in a promise will also end iteration:

```javascript
client.listUsers().each((user) => {
  console.log(user);
  return Promise.resolve(false);
}).then(() => {
  console.log('Only one user was visited');
});
```

Rejecting a promise will end iteration with an error:

```javascript
return client.listUsers().each((user) => {
  console.log(user);
  return Promise.reject('foo error');
}).catch((err)=>{
  console.log(err); // 'foo error'
});
```

## Configuration

There are several ways to provide configuration to the client constructor.  When creating a new client, the following locations are searched in order, in a last-one-wins fashion:

1. An `okta.yaml` file in  `~/.okta`.
1. An `okta.yaml` file in the current working directory of the node process.
1. Environment variables
1. Properties passed to the client constructor

As such, you can create a client without passing a configuration option, e.g. `new okta.Client()`, so long as you have provided the configuration in one of the other locations.

If providing a yaml file, the structure should be the same as the properties that you pass to the client constructor:

```yaml
okta:
  client:
    orgUrl: 'https://dev-1234.oktapreview.com/'
    token: 'xYzabc'
```

If providing environment variables, the configuration names are flattened and delimited with underscores:

```sh
OKTA_CLIENT_ORGURL=https://dev-1234.oktapreview.com/
OKTA_CLIENT_TOKEN=xYzabc
```
