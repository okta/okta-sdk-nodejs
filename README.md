## Installation

```sh
npm install @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs
```

## Usage

All usage of this SDK begins with the creation of a client, the client handles the authentication and communication with the Okta API.  To create a client, you need to provide it the URL of your Okta Org, and an API Token that you have provisioned for yourself (this can be done by visiting API -> Tokens in your Okta Developer Dashboard):

```javascript
const okta = require('@okta/okta-sdk-nodejs');

const client = new okta.Client({
  orgUrl: 'https://dev-1234.oktapreview.com/'
  token: 'xYzabc'    // Obtained from Developer Dashboard
});
```

It is also possible to provide configuration through environment variables or YAML files.  Please see [Configuration](#configuration) for examples.

All interaction with the [Okta Platform API] is done through client methods.  Some examples are below, but for a full list of methods please refer to the JsDoc page for the client:

https://developer.okta.com/okta-sdk-nodejs/jsdocs/Client.html

## Examples

This library is a wrapper for the [Okta Platform API], which should be referred to as the source-of-truth for what is and isn't possible with the API.  In the following sections we show you how to use your client to perform some common operations with the [Okta Platform API].

### Users

#### Create a User

The [Users: Create User] API can be used to create users.  The most basic type of user is one that has an email address and a password to login with, and can be created with the `client.createUser()` method:

```javascript
const newUser = {
  profile: {
    firstName: 'Foo',
    lastName: 'Bar',
    email: 'foo@example.com',
    login: 'foo@example.com',
  },
  credentials: {
    password : {
      value: 'PasswordAbc123'
    }
  }
};

client.createUser(newUser)
.then(user => {
  console.log('Created user', user);
});
```

#### Get a User

The [Users: Get User] API can be used to fetch a user by id or login (as defined on their `profile.login` property), and is wrapped by `client.getUser(:id|:login)`:

```javascript
client.getUser('ausmvdt5xg8wRVI1d0g3')
.then(user => {
  console.log(user);
});

client.getUser('foo@bar.com')
.then(user => {
  console.log(user);
});
```

#### Update a User

Once you have a user instance, you can modify it and then call the `update()` method to persist those changes to the API.  This uses the [Users: Update User] API:

```javascript
user.profile.nickName = 'rob';
user.update()
.then(() => console.log('User nickname change has been saved'));
```

#### Delete a User

Before deleting an Okta user, they must first be deactivated.  Both operations are done with the [Users: Lifecycle Operations] API.  We can chain the `deactivate()` and `delete` operations on the user instance to achieve both calls:

```javascript
user.deactivate()
.then(() => console.log('User has been deactivated'))
.then(() => user.delete())
.then(() => console.log('User has been deleted'));
```

#### List All Org Users

The client can be used to fetch collections of resources, in this example we'll use the [Users: List Users] API.  When fetching collections, you can use the `each()` method to iterate through the collection.  For more information see [Collections](#collections).

```javascript
const orgUsersCollection = client.listUsers();

orgUsersCollection.each(user => {
  console.log(user);
})
.then(() => console.log('All users have been listed'));
```

For more information about this API see [Users: Get User].

#### Search for Users

The [Users: List Users] API provides three ways to search for users, "q", "filter", or "search", and all of these approaches can be achieved by passing them as query parameters to the `client.listUser()` method.  The library will URL encode the values for you.

```javascript
client.listUsers({
  q: 'Robert'
}).each(user => {
  console.log('User matches query: ', user);
});

client.listUsers({
  search: 'profile.nickName eq "abc 1234"'
}).each(user => {
  console.log('User matches search:', user);
});

client.listUsers({
  filter: 'lastUpdated gt "2017-06-05T23:00:00.000Z"'
}).each(user => {
  console.log('User matches filter:', user);
});
```

### Groups

#### Create a Group

The [Groups: Add Group] API allows you to create Groups, and this is wrapped by `client.createGroup(:newGroup)`:

```javascript
const newGroup = {
  profile: {
    name: 'Admin Users Group'
  }
};

client.createGroup(newGroup)
.then(group => {
  console.log('Created group', group);
});
```

#### Assign a User to a Group

With a user and group instance, you can use the `addToGroup(:groupId)` method of the user to add the user to the known group:

```javascript
user.addToGroup(group.id)
.then(() => console.log('User has been added to group'));
```

### Applications

#### Create An Application

The [Applications: Add Application] API allows you to create Okta Applications.  There are many different types of applications that can be created.  Please refer to the [Applications] documentation for details about each application type and what is required when creating the application.

In this example, we create a [Basic Authentication Application]:

```javascript
const application = {
  name: 'template_basic_auth',
  label: 'Sample Basic Auth App',
  signOnMode: 'BASIC_AUTH',
  settings: {
    app: {
      url: 'https://example.com/auth.htm'
      authURL: 'https://example.com/login.html',
    }
  }
};

client.createApplication(application)
.then(application => {
  console.log('Created application:', application);
});
```

#### Assign a User to an Application

To assign a user to an application, you must know the ID of the application and the user:

```javascript
client.assignUserToApplication(createdApplication.id, {
  id: createdUser.id
})
.then(appUser => {
  console.log('Assigned user to app, app user instance:' appUser);
});
```

An App User is created, which is a new user instance that is specific to this application.  An App User allows you define an application-specific profile for that user.  For more information please see [Applications: User Operations] and [Applications: Application User Profile].

#### Assign a Group to an Application

To assign a group to an application, you must know the ID of the application and the group:

```javascript
client.createApplicationGroupAssignment(createdApplication.id, createdGroup.id);
```

### Sessions

#### Create a Session

This is a rarely used method. See [Sessions: Create Session with Session Token] for the common ways to create a session. To use this method, you must have a sessionToken:

```javascript
client.createSession({
  sessionToken: 'your session token'
})
.then(session => {
  console.log('Session details:' session);
});
```

#### Get a Session

To retrieve details about a session, you must know the ID of the session:

```javascript
client.getSession(session.id)
.then(session => {
  console.log('Session details:' session);
});
```

These details include when and how the user authenticated and the session expiration. For more information see [Sessions: Session Properties] and [Sessions: Session Operations].

#### Refresh a Session

To refresh a session before it expires, you must know the ID of the session:

```javascript
client.refreshSession(session.id)
.then(session => {
  console.log('Refreshed session expiration:', session.expiresAt);
});
```

#### End a Session

To end a session, you must know the ID of the session:

```javascript
client.endSession(session.id)
.then(() => {
  console.log('Session ended');
});
```

#### End all Sessions for a User

To end all sessions for a user, you must know the ID of the user:

```javascript
client.endAllUserSessions(user.id)
.then(() => {
  console.log('All user sessions have ended');
});
```

## Collections

When the client is used to fetch collections of resources, a collection instance is returned.  The collection encapsulates the work of paginating the API to fetch all resources in the collection (see [Pagination]).  The collection provides the `each()` method for iterating over the collection, as described below.

### `each()`

Allows you to visit every item in the collection, while optionally doing work at each item.  All calls to `each()` will return a promise that is resolved when all items have been visited or rejected if you return a rejected promise from your iterator.  Iteration can be stopped by rejecting a returned promise, or by returning `false` (will not cause a promise rejection).  The following examples show you the various use-cases.

#### Serial or Parallel Synchronous Work

If no value is returned, each() will continue to the next item:

```javascript
client.listUsers().each(user => {
  console.log(user);
  logUserToRemoteSystem(user);
})
.then(() => {
  console.log('All users have been visited');
});
```

#### Serial Asynchronous Work

Returning a promise will pause the iterator until the promise is resolved:

```javascript
client.listUsers().each(user => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // do work, then resolve or reject the promise
  })
});
```

#### Ending Iteration

Returning false will end iteration:

```javascript
client.listUsers().each(user => {
  console.log(user);
  return false;
})
.then(() => {
  console.log('Only one user was visited');
});
```

Returning false in a promise will also end iteration:

```javascript
client.listUsers().each((user) => {
  console.log(user);
  return Promise.resolve(false);
})
.then(() => {
  console.log('Only one user was visited');
});
```

Rejecting a promise will end iteration with an error:

```javascript
return client.listUsers().each((user) => {
  console.log(user);
  return Promise.reject('foo error');
}).catch((err)=>{
  console.log(err); // 'foo error'
});
```

## Configuration

There are several ways to provide configuration to the client constructor.  When creating a new client, the following locations are searched in order, in a last-one-wins fashion:

1. An `okta.yaml` file in  `~/.okta`.
1. An `okta.yaml` file in the current working directory of the node process.
1. Environment variables
1. Properties passed to the client constructor

As such, you can create a client without passing a configuration option, e.g. `new okta.Client()`, so long as you have provided the configuration in one of the other locations.

If providing a yaml file, the structure should be the same as the properties that you pass to the client constructor:

```yaml
okta:
  client:
    orgUrl: 'https://dev-1234.oktapreview.com/'
    token: 'xYzabc'
```

If providing environment variables, the configuration names are flattened and delimited with underscores:

```sh
OKTA_CLIENT_ORGURL=https://dev-1234.oktapreview.com/
OKTA_CLIENT_TOKEN=xYzabc
```
