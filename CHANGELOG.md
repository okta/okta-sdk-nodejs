## 2.0.0
- Drop support for Node 4

## 1.2.0

- Adds a default request executor that will retry requests when rate limit exceptions have occurred.  Please see the [README](README.md) for full documentation.  This executor is opt-in for now, but will be used by default in the 2.0 release.

## 1.1.0

- Add an HTTP cache for simple resources fetched by GET.
