### Code Generation

Some of this SDK is auto-generated from our API Spec, defined as an Open API JSON Schema file.  Files that are auto-generated have a banner at the top which indicate this.  As such, modifying the SDK may require you to edit one of the templates in the `templates/` directory.

To re-build the auto generated files, use this command in a cloned copy of this repo (after ensuring the dev dependencies have been installed):

```sh
npm run build
```

If there are modifications to the auto-generated files, please include those changes in your pull request.

The JSON schema is brought in through the `@okta/openapi` dependency, so please ensure that you are using the version indicated by package.json in this library.

### Running The Tests

By default the test harness will execute an integration test against a live Okta Org.  As such the following environment variables must be required for the test process to use:

```bash
OKTA_CLIENT_ORGURL=https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/
OKTA_CLIENT_TOKEN=xxxx_api_token
```

Then run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```
